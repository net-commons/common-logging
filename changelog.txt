Common.Logging CHANGELOG
=====================================
http://netcommon.sf.net

Release 2.1.0, June 8 2012

Summary: New Features and Bug Fix release

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Starting with version 2.1.0, support for .NET versions 2.0 and 3.0 has been deprecated - if you need support
for those platforms please download Common.Logging 2.0.  Common.Logging 2.1 now supports .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.

Breaking Changes
*) Beginning with Common.Logging 2.1, there are no longer any "unversioned-named" logging framework assemblies provided.
Instead, the names of all adapter assemblies now include the explicit logging framework version which they target.
As an example, the following assemblies are no longer provided:
 * Common.Logging.Log4Net.dll
 * Common.Logging.NLog.dll
 * Common.Logging.EntLib.dll
 
In their place, _all_ assemblies now have specific version suffixes as in the following examples:
 * Common.Logging.Log4Net1210.dll
 * Common.Logging.Log4Net1211.dll
 * Common.Logging.NLog10.dll
 * Common.Logging.NLog20.dll
 * Common.Logging.EntLib41.dll
 * Common.Logging.EntLib50.dll
 * etc.

The 'suffix' on the assembly name denotes the exact version of the logging framework which each adapter is targeting.
This is intended to assist developers in selecting the proper assembly for the correct version of the logging
framework which they are using.  Note however that this means that 'upgrading' from past versions of Common.Logging
may now result in the need to reference an adapter assembly with a (slightly) different filename.

Feature Requests

- Add support for EntLib 5.0 logging
- Add support for Log4Net 1.2.11
- Add explicit compilation targets for .NET 4 binaries
- Automate creating and bundling of NuGet packages to ease release process

Bug Fixes
